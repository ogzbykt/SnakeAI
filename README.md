# SnakeAI
This was my first attempt at Machine Learning and AI. I worked on this passion project to get better at Java. 
The idea behind the project is using a Hamiltonian Cycle to solve the board and using a reinforcement learning algorithm to find the said cycle.

IMPORTANT:
To be able to run this project You need an external library from Pearson. The library is called "stdlib.jar".
You can find the download link and more info on pearson libraries here:
